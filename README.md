This is a console board game called reversi. The objective of the game is to have the most stones on the board. You are playing against 
"machine". You and machine take turns placing stones on the board and you can reverse stones by placing stones on both sides of one or 
more machine stones in any direction. Machine can do the same thing to your stones and will always place stones beside yours to increase
it's chances of reversing your stones. Multiple stones in multiple directions can be reversed by placing one stone. Only a newly placed 
stone can reverse opponent stones. When there are no more spots left on the board the game is over and a winner is named. If there is a 
tie the winner can be decided by playing rock, paper, scissors against machine.
